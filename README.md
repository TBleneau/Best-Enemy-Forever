# Best Enemy Forever
##### GameJam 19/03/2019 : Impact Jam Epitech

### The Story
###### For many years, orcs have been held in slavery by humans.
###### Ships transit between "Orkia", the continent of the orcs, and the human continent in order to enslave them.
###### But one day, a violent storm took a human ship from its course.
###### All but two perish : a human and an orc.
###### In order to survive, they'll have to cooperate.
